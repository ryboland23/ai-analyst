## Executive Summary

New user conversion from signup to first purchase has declined from 12.4% to 8.1% over the past four months, a 35% relative drop concentrated in the onboarding-to-first-browse step. Mobile users are disproportionately affected, converting at less than half the rate of desktop users (5.2% vs. 11.8%). The decline is steepest among users acquired through paid search, suggesting that recent ad campaigns are driving lower-intent traffic. We recommend prioritizing the mobile onboarding flow and reassessing paid search targeting criteria.

## Funnel Analysis: Signup to First Purchase

### Overall Funnel
| Step                | Users  | Conversion (step) | Conversion (overall) | Median Time to Next |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Signup           | 10,000 | --                | --                  | --                  |
| 2. Onboarding done  | 6,820  | 68.2%             | 68.2%               | 0.4 days            |
| 3. First browse     | 4,115  | 60.3%             | 41.2%               | 1.2 days            |
| 4. Add to cart      | 1,847  | 44.9%             | 18.5%               | 2.8 days            |
| 5. First purchase   | 812    | 44.0%             | 8.1%                | 0.3 days            |

**Overall conversion:** 8.1% (signup to first purchase)
**Biggest absolute drop-off:** Signup to Onboarding -- 3,180 users lost (31.8%)
**Biggest relative drop-off:** First browse to Add to cart -- only 44.9% continue, and this is where the recent decline is concentrated

### Funnel by Platform
| Step                | Desktop (n=4,210) | Mobile (n=4,893) | Tablet (n=897) |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1. Signup           | 100%              | 100%             | 100%           |
| 2. Onboarding done  | 74.1%             | 63.2%            | 68.5%          |
| 3. First browse     | 49.8%             | 34.1%            | 40.2%          |
| 4. Add to cart      | 23.5%             | 14.0%            | 18.9%          |
| 5. First purchase   | 11.8%             | 5.2%             | 8.7%           |

**Insight:** Mobile conversion (5.2%) is less than half of desktop (11.8%). The gap widens at every funnel step but is most pronounced at Onboarding -> First Browse, where mobile users drop off at 46% vs. 33% for desktop. This suggests the mobile onboarding experience is losing users before they ever engage with the product.

## Segmentation Analysis

### By Acquisition Channel
| Channel        | Users | % of Total | Conversion Rate | vs. Average | Trend (MoM) |
|----------------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Organic search | 3,215 | 32.2%     | 11.3%          | +39%        | Stable       |
| Direct         | 2,108 | 21.1%     | 10.1%          | +25%        | Stable       |
| Referral       | 1,542 | 15.4%     | 9.8%           | +21%        | +5% MoM      |
| Paid search    | 2,013 | 20.1%     | 4.2%           | -48%        | -18% MoM     |
| Social         | 1,122 | 11.2%     | 3.9%           | -52%        | -12% MoM     |

**Insight:** Paid search and Social are the worst-converting channels at 4.2% and 3.9% respectively -- less than half the overall average. Worse, both are declining month-over-month. Organic and Direct users convert at 2.5-3x the rate of paid users, suggesting that paid campaigns are acquiring users with low purchase intent. The shift in acquisition channel mix (paid search grew from 15% to 20% of signups in Q4) partially explains the overall conversion decline.

**Chart 3: Conversion Rate by Channel**
![Conversion by Channel](charts/novamart_channel_conversion.png)
*Horizontal bar chart sorted by conversion rate. Organic search at top (11.3%), Social at bottom (3.9%). Vertical dashed line at 8.1% average. Paid search and Social highlighted in red. Annotation: "Paid channels convert at less than half the rate of organic."*

### By Region
| Region         | Users | % of Total | Conversion Rate | vs. Average |
|----------------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| North America  | 3,811 | 38.1%     | 9.4%           | +16%        |
| Europe         | 2,905 | 29.1%     | 8.3%           | +2%         |
| Asia-Pacific   | 2,187 | 21.9%     | 6.8%           | -16%        |
| Latin America  | 680   | 6.8%      | 5.1%           | -37%        |
| Other          | 417   | 4.2%      | 4.8%           | -41%        |

**Insight:** Regional differences exist but are moderate compared to channel and platform differences. North America leads at 9.4% but only 16% above average. The more notable pattern is that Latin America and Asia-Pacific have both conversion and engagement gaps that may relate to product localization or payment method availability.

### By Plan Type at Signup
| Plan    | Users | % of Total | Conversion Rate | vs. Average |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Pro     | 3,512 | 35.1%     | 12.8%          | +58%        |
| Free    | 4,087 | 40.9%     | 5.9%           | -27%        |
| Trial   | 2,401 | 24.0%     | 6.1%           | -25%        |

**Insight:** Pro users convert to first purchase at more than double the rate of Free and Trial users. This makes sense -- Pro users have already demonstrated purchase willingness by paying for the plan. The real question is why Trial users (24% of signups) convert at nearly the same low rate as Free users. The trial experience may not be effectively demonstrating product value.

## Drivers Analysis

### Top Drivers of First-Purchase Conversion
| Rank | Variable              | Correlation | Group Comparison | Direction |
|------|-----------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1    | Platform (desktop)    | 0.31       | 2.3x gap        | Positive  |
| 2    | Onboarding completed  | 0.28       | 2.1x gap        | Positive  |
| 3    | Channel (organic)     | 0.24       | 2.7x gap        | Positive  |
| 4    | Browse count (>3)     | 0.22       | 1.8x gap        | Positive  |
| 5    | Plan type (Pro)       | 0.19       | 2.2x gap        | Positive  |

**Key driver narrative:** The strongest predictor of first purchase is platform -- desktop users simply convert better. But the second strongest is onboarding completion, which is actionable: users who complete onboarding are 2.1x more likely to purchase. Since the mobile onboarding completion rate is only 63% (vs. 74% on desktop), improving mobile onboarding could address both the #1 and #2 drivers simultaneously.

## Stakeholder Narrative

### Context
The product team flagged that new user conversion to first purchase has been declining since October. We analyzed the full NovaMart dataset -- 10,000 user signups, 150,000+ events across 5 months -- to understand where and why users are dropping off.

### Key Findings

**Finding 1: Mobile onboarding is the biggest bottleneck.**
Mobile users convert at 5.2%, less than half the desktop rate of 11.8%. The gap is widest during onboarding: 37% of mobile users drop off before their first browse, compared to 25% on desktop. With mobile representing 49% of all signups, this single bottleneck accounts for an estimated 30-40% of the overall conversion decline.

**Finding 2: Paid search is driving low-quality traffic.**
Users from paid search convert at 4.2% -- less than half the rate of organic search (11.3%). Paid search's share of signups grew from 15% to 20% in Q4, meaning the overall conversion decline is partially a mix shift: we're acquiring more users, but they're less likely to buy. Paid search conversion is also declining at 18% month-over-month.

**Finding 3: Onboarding completion is the most actionable lever.**
Users who complete onboarding are 2.1x more likely to make a first purchase. Onboarding completion is the second-strongest driver of conversion, and unlike platform (which we can't change), onboarding is entirely within our control to improve.

### Insight
The conversion decline is not a single-cause problem -- it's a combination of a deteriorating mobile experience and a shift toward lower-intent acquisition channels. These two issues compound each other: paid search drives a disproportionate share of mobile signups, and mobile onboarding loses those users before they ever engage.

### Implication
At the current trajectory, first-purchase conversion will drop below 7% within two months. With an average first-purchase value of $47, each percentage point of conversion represents approximately $47,000 in monthly revenue from the current signup volume. The 4.3-point decline from 12.4% to 8.1% represents roughly $200,000/month in unrealized revenue.

### Recommendations
1. **Prioritize mobile onboarding redesign** (high confidence): The mobile onboarding completion rate of 63% is the single most fixable bottleneck. Target: bring mobile onboarding completion to 72% (desktop parity minus 2%) within 6 weeks. Expected impact: +1.5-2.0 points of overall conversion.

2. **Audit paid search targeting and landing pages** (high confidence): Paid search CPA has likely held steady while conversion-to-purchase has dropped 18% MoM. Recalculate effective CAC including downstream conversion. Consider tightening targeting or shifting budget to higher-intent keywords.

3. **Investigate the Trial-to-Purchase gap** (medium confidence): Trial users convert at nearly the same rate as Free users (6.1% vs. 5.9%), suggesting the trial experience isn't demonstrating enough value. This warrants a separate deep-dive into the trial user journey.

## Supporting Data
- **Charts referenced:** `charts/novamart_funnel.png`, `charts/novamart_funnel_platform.png`, `charts/novamart_channel_conversion.png`, `charts/novamart_drivers.png`
- **Key metrics cited:** Conversion rates derived from `novamart.events` (purchase events / signup events per user); engagement metrics from event counts per user in `novamart.events`; user attributes from `novamart.users`
- **Time range:** September 2024 through January 2025
- **Caveats:**
  - Platform and onboarding completion are correlated (r=0.35), so their individual driver effects may partially overlap
  - January 2025 cohort has limited maturity; their conversion may increase as they age
  - Revenue estimates assume constant AOV of $47, which may vary by segment

## Data Limitations
- **No A/B test data.** Causal claims (e.g., "improving onboarding will increase conversion") are based on observational correlations, not experiments.
- **Event properties not fully parsed.** The `properties` JSON column contains additional context (page names, button clicks) that was not decomposed in this analysis. A deeper UX funnel analysis could use these fields.
- **Acquisition channel may be misattributed.** Last-touch attribution is assumed. Users who arrive via paid search but return via direct may be miscategorized.
- **Small sample in some segments.** The "Other" region (417 users) and Tablet platform (897 users) have smaller samples. Findings for these segments should be treated as directional.
