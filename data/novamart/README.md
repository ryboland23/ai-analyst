# NovaMart Dataset

## What is NovaMart?

NovaMart is a **fictional mid-stage e-commerce marketplace** (think Amazon-like) that serves as the built-in practice dataset. It includes:

- **Multi-platform presence** -- web, iOS, and Android apps
- **NovaMart Plus** -- a paid delivery membership program (like Amazon Prime)
- **Multi-channel acquisition** -- organic, paid search, social, referral, email, and TikTok ads
- **Full-funnel behavioral data** -- from page views through checkout and purchase

The dataset covers **January through December 2024** and contains approximately 50,000 users with 6.5 million behavioral events. All data is synthetic but designed to behave like a real e-commerce product -- including realistic conversion funnels, seasonality, and segmentation patterns worth investigating.

## Entity Relationship Summary

The diagram below shows how tables connect. All relationships use the column name shown.

```
users
 |
 |-- user_id --> events
 |-- user_id --> sessions
 |-- user_id --> orders
 |-- user_id --> memberships
 |-- user_id --> support_tickets
 |-- user_id --> nps_responses
 |-- user_id --> experiment_assignments

orders
 |-- order_id --> order_items
 |-- order_id --> support_tickets.order_id (nullable, ~60% of tickets)
 |-- promo_id --> promotions.promo_id (nullable)

events
 |-- session_id --> sessions.session_id
 |-- product_id --> products.product_id (nullable, product-related events only)

orders
 |-- session_id --> sessions.session_id

experiment_assignments
 |-- experiment_id --> experiments.experiment_id

calendar
 |-- date --> can be joined to any date column (event_date, order_date, etc.)
```

**Key joins you will use often:**

| To answer... | Join... |
|-------------|---------|
| User behavior + demographics | `events` JOIN `users` ON `user_id` |
| What was purchased | `orders` JOIN `order_items` ON `order_id` JOIN `products` ON `product_id` |
| Session-level funnels | `events` filtered by `session_id`, or use the `sessions` table directly |
| Membership status at time of event | `memberships` JOIN on `user_id` WHERE event timestamp between `started_at` and `ended_at` |
| Support tickets for a specific order | `support_tickets` JOIN `orders` ON `order_id` |
| NPS by user attributes | `nps_responses` JOIN `users` ON `user_id` |
| Experiment outcomes | `experiment_assignments` JOIN `orders` or `events` ON `user_id` |
| Fill date gaps in time series | `calendar` LEFT JOIN your aggregated data ON `date` |

## Quick-Start Queries

These queries work in DuckDB (via the `novamart_practice.duckdb` file) or against the CSV files loaded into any SQL engine. They will help you confirm the data is loaded and get oriented.

### 1. Row counts for every table

```sql
SELECT 'users' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM users
UNION ALL SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
UNION ALL SELECT 'promotions', COUNT(*) FROM promotions
UNION ALL SELECT 'experiments', COUNT(*) FROM experiments
UNION ALL SELECT 'events', COUNT(*) FROM events
UNION ALL SELECT 'sessions', COUNT(*) FROM sessions
UNION ALL SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders
UNION ALL SELECT 'order_items', COUNT(*) FROM order_items
UNION ALL SELECT 'memberships', COUNT(*) FROM memberships
UNION ALL SELECT 'support_tickets', COUNT(*) FROM support_tickets
UNION ALL SELECT 'nps_responses', COUNT(*) FROM nps_responses
UNION ALL SELECT 'experiment_assignments', COUNT(*) FROM experiment_assignments
UNION ALL SELECT 'calendar', COUNT(*) FROM calendar;
```

### 2. Users by acquisition channel

```sql
SELECT acquisition_channel,
       COUNT(*) AS users,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 1) AS pct
FROM users
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### 3. Monthly revenue trend

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS orders,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS buyers,
       ROUND(SUM(total_amount), 2) AS revenue,
       ROUND(AVG(total_amount), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

### 4. Checkout funnel conversion by device

```sql
SELECT device,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'product_view' THEN 1 END) AS product_views,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'add_to_cart' THEN 1 END) AS add_to_cart,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'checkout_started' THEN 1 END) AS checkout_started,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'payment_attempted' THEN 1 END) AS payment_attempted,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'purchase_complete' THEN 1 END) AS purchase_complete
FROM events
WHERE event_type IN ('product_view', 'add_to_cart', 'checkout_started',
                      'payment_attempted', 'purchase_complete')
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

### 5. NPS score distribution by segment

```sql
SELECT user_segment,
       COUNT(*) AS responses,
       ROUND(AVG(score), 1) AS avg_score,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN score >= 9 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) AS pct_promoter,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN score <= 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) AS pct_detractor,
       ROUND(100.0 * (
           SUM(CASE WHEN score >= 9 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) -
           SUM(CASE WHEN score <= 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
       ) / COUNT(*), 1) AS nps
FROM nps_responses
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

### 6. Support tickets by category and severity

```sql
SELECT category,
       COUNT(*) AS total_tickets,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN severity = 'critical' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) AS pct_critical,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN severity = 'high' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) AS pct_high,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) AS pct_resolved
FROM support_tickets
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
